# rag_practice

Learning RAG via lessons from an expert, https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques/tree/main ; this repo contains all the lessons completed actually in google colab with llamaindex and in-memory vector store. 

Ever wondered, how do i create ai (llm) that can answer questions from latest data or private data rather than the big llms don't know?

I wondered about the same question and learnt about RAG, passing information from data provided by you to ai chatbots based on the question you ask. And chatbots really do give great answers based on that. I checked it myself.
